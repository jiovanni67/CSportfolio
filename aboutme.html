<h1>(Stuff about me) My name is Jiovanni Rodriguez im a sophomore at Everest Public High School. I grew up in Redwood City CA. My two favorite movies that I like is 22 jump street and Super bad, I like them because they're very funny. My favorite hobbie is baseball, I like to play this sport because I like hitting the ball with the bat. I got into this sport because one day my friend made me play baseball with him so I did and I liked it since that day.</h1>
